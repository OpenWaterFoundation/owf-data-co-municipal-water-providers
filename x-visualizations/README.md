# x-visualizations

This folder contains and early attempt at visualizing the data.

Current visualizations are implemented using tools such as the
[Poudre Basin Information](https://poudre.openwaterfoundation.org) website and the 
[Colorado Municipal Water Providers](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/owf/municipal-water-providers/) dataset landing page.
